## Author: Ryan Cobb

If you own a computer it is vital that you are aware of the potential threats that can harm your computer and that you know how to properly protect yourself from them. This tutorial is aimed at doing just that, by providing brief information on those threats and the basic steps on how to secure your computer.

## Most Common Types of Threats

### Denial of Service Attack (DoS Attack)

A [denial-of-service attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack) is any type of attack in which an attacker(hacker) attempts to prevent a legitimate user from accessing a service or shut down a machine or network. The attacker will usually do this by sending a "flood" of messages asking the network or server to authenticate requests that have invalid return addresses. This results in a crash that can affect services such as email, websites, online accounts (like banking), and other services that rely on the affected computer or network. DoS attacks can cost organization precious time and money as a result of their services being inaccessible. 

##### *Protection*

1. Recognize the signs of an attack: 
  * The best defense against a DoS attack is the ability to recognize it early. Invest in the right tech, expertise and training and this will help you to decipher or use an anti-DoS service.
 
2. Enroll in a [DoS protection service](https://www.cloudflare.com/forrester-wave-ddos-mitigation-2017/?_bt=295950859916&_bk=ddos%20protect&_bm=e&_bn=g&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIz_DIo_KM3wIVjITICh3iNwwzEAAYAiAAEgLYhvD_BwE) 
  * A good service can detect abnormal traffic flows and redirect traffic away from your network. The DoS traffic is then filtered out, while clean traffic is passed on to your network.
  
3. Create a disaster recovery plan to ensure successful and efficient communication, mitigation, and recovery in the event of an attack.
 

### Malware

[Malware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware), or malicious software, is any program or file that is harmful to a computer user. Malware includes computer viruses, worms, Trojan horses and spyware. These malicious programs can perform a variety of functions, including stealing, encrypting or deleting sensitive data, altering or hijacking core computing functions and monitoring users' computer activity without their permission.

Types of Malware 
  * **Virus**: most common type of malware, and it's defined as a malicious program that can execute itself and spreads by infecting other programs or files
  * **Worm**: can self-replicate without a host program; worms typically spread without any human interaction or directives from the malware authors
  * **Trojan Horse**: a malicious program that is designed to appear as a legitimate program; once activated following installation, Trojans can execute their malicious functions
  * **Spyware**: a kind of malware that is designed to collect information and data on users and observe their activity without users' knowledge
 
##### *Protection*

1. Use of [anti-virus software](https://us.norton.com/norton-360-antivirus-plus?inid=hho_nortoncom_home_hero11_norton-360-antivirus-plus) and firewall

2. Make sure to continuously update all your software.
 * As these updates may include security updates to protect against the various types of Malware. 

3. Avoidance of certain Operating Systems. 
 * Microsoft Windows hands down is the most hacked and infected Operating System known to man. The upkeep of security updates is especially critical when surfing on a Windows PC.The use of the UNIX or Linux Operating System, for example, offers superior protection against Malware compared to Microsoft Windows. Ironically, UNIX and Linux are available by freeware and/or shareware.Tiger and Safari are examples of the most secure operating systems available to home users.

### Phishing

[Phishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing) attacks attempt to gain sensitive, confidential information such as usernames, passwords, credit card information, network credentials, and more. By posing as a legitimate individual or institution via phone or email, cyber attackers use social engineering to manipulate victims into performing specific actions—like clicking on a malicious link or attachment—or willfully divulging confidential information.

Types of Phishing Attacks

* **Spear Fishing**: Spear phishing email messages won’t look as random as more general phishing attempts. Attackers will often gather information about their targets to fill emails with more authentic context. Some attackers even hijack business email communications and create highly customized messages.
* **Clone phishing**: Clone phishing is a type of phishing attack whereby a legitimate, and previously delivered, email containing an attachment or link has had its content and recipient address(es) taken and used to create an almost identical or cloned email.
* **Whaling**: Whaling specifically targets high profile and/or senior executives in an organization. The content of a whaling attempt will often present as a legal communication or other high-level executive business.

##### *Protection*

1. The best way to spot phishing emails is to understand the different types. Click this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFUW6WVtgkg) to get a good look at a real live phishing website.

2. Keep your software updated

3. Use a password manager with auto-fill

4. Verify Emails with Senders

5. Open Suspicious Documents in Google Drive

### Spam

[Spam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spamming) is one of the more common methods of both sending information out and collecting it from unsuspecting people. It is the mass distribution of unsolicited messages, advertising or pornography to addresses which can be easily found on the Internet through things like social networking sites, company websites and personal blogs. 

What Spam Can Do To Your Computer
 
* Annoy you with unwanted junk mail.
* Create a burden for communications service providers and businesses to filter electronic messages.
* Phish for your information by tricking you into following links or entering details with too-good-to-be-true offers and promotions.
* Provide a vehicle for malware, scams, fraud and threats to your privacy.

##### *Protection*

1. Don't post your address on a publicly searchable web page if you can avoid it. (It's good practice for departments and organizations to use functional rather than personal addresses.)

2. Only give out your email address to reputable organizations with good privacy policies (yes, you should read the privacy policies) 

3. For all other sites, if you must give out an email address, use one you don't care about (a free one from a service like hotmail for example).

4. Don't ever reply to spam or use the "option" to unsubscribe -- that just tells the spammer they have found a real person willing to read what they are sending.
